Description: Calculation and analysis of the codon pair bias given any set of
    protein coding genes, calculation of the codon pair score of any gene
    relative to a codon pair bias, and a versatile gene design algorithm which
    generates recoded sequences with customized codon pair scores, or random
    permutations, relative to the codon pair bias of one or two references. The
    design algorithm also allows for the exclusion of user defined sequence
    elements during recoding and supports regular expressions. Codon usage and
    amino acid order are never altered by recoding.
